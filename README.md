Record collector is a simple program for keeping track of and organizing your physical records (or concert bootlegs)

The project grew out of my own frustration of not finding or knowing what vinyl records I had, since alot of them was inherited from my father. I also realised that this is a better way of organizing all my concert bootlegs instead of just using lists. This project is also a learning experience for myself for both working with Java, software engineering, object orientated programming, databases and such. 

## Features

  - Add records
  - Search for records
  - Let the project choose a record for you!

The program at the moment is command line only, GUI will be added shortly. 

## Dev plan

  - Add GUI
  - Add functionality for adding bootlegs (atm only "ordinary" records)
  - Move from csv based data storage to actual database
  - Better search and listing of items

Please see NEWS.md for release notes and other.
